I then see whether this has been encountered by checking if it is present in `nums_checked`. This approach allows me to iterate through the array only once, so it has better time complexity than the nested-loop solution. However, as this requires me to create the hash table (which could be as large as $N$) it has worse space complexity. It is also more difficult to understand.\n",

If the sum is larger than the `target`, I know I must decrease the sum in order to reach the target. I must therefore move the right pointer leftward, as this is the only way to decrease the sum. If the sum is smaller than the `target`, the opposite is true, so I must move the left pointer rightward. The algorithm stops when it finds the pair which sum to the `target` or when the left pointer crosses the right pointer (in which case, the target cannot be found).\n",
