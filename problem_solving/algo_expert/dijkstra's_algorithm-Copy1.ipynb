    "You're given an integer start and a list edges of pairs of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list is what's called an adjacency list, and it represents a graph. The number of vertices in the graph is equal to the length of edges, where each index i in edges contains vertex i's outbound edges in no particular order. Each individual edge is represented by a pair of two numbers, [destination, distance], where the destination is a positive integer denoting the destination vertex and the distance is a positive integer representing the length fo the edge (the distance from vertex i to vertex destination. Note that these edges are directed, meaning that you can only travel from a particular vertex to its destination, not the other way around (unless the destination vertex itself has an outbound edge to the original vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that computes the lengths of the shortest paths between start and all the other vertices in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm and returns them in an array. Each index i in the output array should represent the length fo the shortest path between start and vertex i. If no path is found from start to vertex i, then output[i] should be -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the graph represented by edges won't contain any self-loopts (vertices that have an outbound edge to themselves) and will only have positively weighted edges (i.e. no negative distances).\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Start from the starting node and explore all the nodes from which it leads. This gives the shortest distance to each of these nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then find the (unvisited) node with the shortest distance and explore the nodes from which it leads. This gives a distance to each of these nodes which may or may not be the shortest distance found to them so far. Repeat this step until you have visited each of the nodes and traversed each of the edges coming from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an optimisation, you do not need to consider fully an edge coming from a node x to node y when the shortest distance to node x is greater than the shortest distance to node y. This is because the distanced traversed going to y via x must be at least greater than the shortest distance to x, which we know is already greater than the shortest distance to y. This optimisation does not work when the distances can be negative.\n",
